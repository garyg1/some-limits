# splines

### Project Structure
The source code is located in `src/`. Since this project is written in TypeScript, the source must be compiled to JavaScript. 
The built JavaScript is located in `built/`.

### Compiling it yourself
The project includes the pre-compiled `.js` files, but you can also re-compile.
```
npm install -g typescript # if TypeScript compiler is not installed
tsc
```
